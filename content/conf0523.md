# Workshop on Homology of Configuration Spaces and related topics

Configuration spaces are classical objects in algebraic topology, but the study of their homotopy type remains a difficult question.
The purpose of this conference is to bring together experts on that study, with a focus on the phenomenon known as homological stability.
They will be invited to give talk about recent developments on the subject and we hope that the workshop will open up discussions about new avenues of research.

This three-day workshop will consist in talks from invited speakers and a mini-course on secondary stability.
It will provide ample times for informal discussions.
